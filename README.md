## 📚 About This Repository

This repository is created to help students and beginners who want to learn C programming step-by-step with practical coding exercises.  
Here, you'll find programs covering fundamental concepts such as:

- Basic syntax and structure of C programs  
- Variables, data types, and input/output  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- Arrays and strings  
- Functions and recursion  
- Simple algorithms and problem solving  

Each program is simple to understand and well-commented to explain what the code does.

## 📖 Learning Tips

- Read the comments inside each program carefully.  
- Try to write the same programs on your own without looking.  
- Change input values and observe how the program behaves.  
- Attempt to solve small problems by combining multiple concepts learned.  
- Regular practice is key — try to code daily!
